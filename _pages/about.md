I am Yang Liu, a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. I am on the 2020/2021 job market and am available for interviews.

**Research Interests**: Empirical Asset Pricing, Machine Learning, Investment Management

My research covers the global financial markets, with a strong focus on the Chinese stock markets.
In a study on Chinese A-Share, I incorporate the volume info to construct a Trend factor to
reflect the critical feature of large individual trading in China.
The resulting factor model significantly outperforms the existing models in terms of the explanatory power, 
serving as the Carhart model in China. 
We also provide a theoretical explanation of the trend factor and verify it across international market tests. 

In another study on machine learning (ML), I use genetic programming (GP) to construct a
new framework for predicting the cross-section of stock returns. Different from the
common ML algorithms which focus on minimizing the mean-squared error, I employ GP
 to maximize an economic objective, the Sharpe ratio of the usual spread portfolio. 
 Compared with the conventional regression-based methods and
the neural network, GP can double their performance in the US, and outperform them
internationally.
