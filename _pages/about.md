Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor of Finance in Hunan Univeristy.
I received the Ph.d. degree in Finance from Tsinghua University in 2021,
and the bachelor degress in Financial Engineering from Central University of Finance and Economics in 2015.

**Research Interests**: Empirical Asset Pricing, Machine Learning, Behavioral Finance

My research covers the global financial markets, with a strong focus on the Chinese stock markets.
In a study on Chinese A-Share, I incorporate the volume info to construct a Trend factor to
reflect the critical feature of large individual trading in China.
The resulting factor model significantly outperforms the existing models in terms of the explanatory power, 
serving as the Carhart model in China. 
We also provide a theoretical explanation of the trend factor and verify it across international market tests. 

In another study on machine learning (ML), I use genetic programming (GP)
to construct a new framework for predicting the cross-section of stock returns by
  maximizing an economic objective, the Sharpe ratio of the usual spread portfolio. 
 Compared with the conventional regression-based methods and
the neural network, GP can double their performance in the US, and outperform them
internationally.
