+ **Trend Factor in China: The Role of Large Individual Trading**, (Under review) with Guofu zhou (WashU) and Yingzi Zhu (TsinghuaU)
  + *Best Paper Award in 2020 FMA Annual Meeting <small>(Semi-finalist)</small>, Best Paper Award in 2020 THU-PKU-RUC EMDS*
  + We propose a 4-factor model for the Chinese stock market by adding a trend factor into the market, size, and value of Liu, Stambaugh, and Yuan's (2019) 
  3-factor model. Because of up to 80% of individual trading, the trend factor captures salient relevant price and volume trends,
  and earns a monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.48, much greater than that of the market (0.11), size (0.20), and value (0.28). 
  The 4-factor model explains well a number of stylized facts and anomalies of the Chinese stock market. It also explains well mutual fund returns, 
  serving as an analogue of Carhart’s (1997) model in China.

+ **Maximizing the Sharpe Ratio: A Genetic Programming Approach**, with Guofu zhou (WashU) and Yingzi Zhu (TsinghuaU)
  + While common machine learning algorithms focus on minimizing the mean-square errors of model fit, 
  we show that genetic programming, GP, is well-suited to maximize an economic objective, the Sharpe ratio of 
  the usual spread portfolio in the cross-section of expected stock returns. In contrast to popular regression-based 
  learning tools and the neural network, GP can double their performance in the US, and outperform them internationally. 
  We find that, while the economic objective plays a role, GP captures nonlinearity in comparison with methods like Lasso, 
  and it requires smaller sample than neural network.

+ **Return Asymmetry and the Cross-section of Stock Returns: Theory and Evidence**, with Yingzi Zhu (TsinghuaU)
  + We extend the CAPM to incorporate the return asymmetry in the cross-section of stock returns. We
motivate our asymmetry measure based on a general return distribution beyond normal distribution and
derive the risk premium due to asymmetry. Empirically, our asymmetry measure negatively predicts the
expected cross-sectional returns. The further decomposition shows that the idiosyncratic asymmetry
dominates the systematic asymmetry in stocks with greater individual investor participation, although on
average, the systematic asymmetry dominates. 



Work in Progress

+ **Market Closure and Short-Term Reversal**, with Pasquale Della Corte (Imperial College London), Robert Kosowski (Imperial College London) and Tianyu Wang (TsinghuaU)
  + A strategy that buys securities with low past overnight returns and sells securities with high 
  past overnight returns generates sizeable out-of-sample excess returns and Sharpe ratios. 
  This strategy -- labelled as overnight-intraday reversal strategy -- outperforms the conventional
  short-term reversal strategy for major international equity markets and futures written on equity indices, 
  interest rates, commodities, and currencies. Consistent with time-varying limits to arbitrage we find that 
  cross-sectional return volatility explains the returns from this strategy.

+ **Technical Analysis in the Stock Market: A Review**, with Yufeng Han (UNCC), Guofu Zhou (WashU), and Yingzi Zhu (TsinghuaU)
  + Technical analysis is the study for forecasting prices via past data. In this survey, we examine not only the time-series predictive power of technical indicators on the aggregated stock market and various portfolios, but also the cross-sectional predictability of stocks whose long-short portfolios earn substantial abnormal returns. We focus on reviewing and updating some of the major academic research on traditional technical analysis methods, but also discuss briefly some of the recent machine learning approaches such as Lasso, neural network and genetic programming.

+ **Choosing Factors: Explanatory Power vs Model Parsimony**
  + We examine which factor collection, in the model space spanned by existing factors, performs best in terms of the balance between explanatory power and model parsimony. Taking the union of the factors in the recent notable models, our comparison of 512 models shows that Liu, Zhou, and Zhu’s (2020) four factor model achieves the greatest explanatory power measured by the Sharpe ratio among all those satisfying model parsimony condition. Moreover, this model exhibits greater ability in explaining various test assets, and it also earns persistent premium.

+ **Overnight-intraday Reversal in China**, (in Chinese) with Ronghua Qu and Tianyu Wang
  + We find a significant overnight-intraday reversal effect in the Chinese A share stock market, i.e., the
stocks with lower (higher) overnight returns will on average earn higher (lower) future intraday returns.
This overnight-intraday reversal effect substantially outperforms the traditional reversal effect by earning
a much higher daily return of 1.12% and a greater annualized Sharpe ratio up to 18.02. Moreover, this
effect increases with the stock illiquidity, the short-sale constraint, and individual ownership, indicating
that the illiquidity premium and investor sentiment are the two driving forces behind this reversal effect.
