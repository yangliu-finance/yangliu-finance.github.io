+ **Trend Factor in China: The Role of Large Individual Trading**, with Guofu Zhou and Yingzi Zhu
  + **<font color="red">Review of Asset Pricing Studies</font>**, <font color="red">forthcoming</font>.
  + *Best Paper Award in 2020 FMA Annual Meeting <small>(Semi-finalist)</small>, Best Paper Award in 2020 THU-PKU-RUC EMDS*
  + Presented at: 2018 CFRIC, 2018 IAFDS, 2019 CICF, 2019 WRADSP, 2019 NZFM, 2019 AFBC, 2020 THU-PKU-RUC EMDS, 2020 FMA, 2021 AFA Ph.D. Poster.

  + We propose a novel trend factor for the Chinese stock market, which incorporates both price and volume information to capture dominant individual trading, momentum, and liquidity. We find that volume plays a more significant role in the trend factor for China than for the US, reflecting the greater retail participation in China. By incorporating this trend factor into the 3-factor model of Liu et al. (2019), we propose a 4-factor model that explains a wide range of stylized facts and 60 representative anomalies. Our study highlights the important role of individual trading in asset pricing, especially in China.

+ **Technical Analysis in the Stock Market: A Review**, with Yufeng Han, Guofu Zhou, and Yingzi Zhu
  + **Handbook of Investment Analysis, Portfolio Management, and Financial Derivatives**, forthcoming.
  + Available at: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3850494](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3850494)
  + Technical analysis is the study for forecasting future asset prices with past data. In this survey, we review and extend studies on not only the time-series predictive power of technical indicators on the aggregated stock market and various portfolios, but also the cross-sectional predictability with various firm characteristics. While we focus on reviewing major academic research on using traditional technical indicators, but also discuss briefly recent studies that apply machine learning approaches, such as Lasso, neural network and genetic programming, to forecast returns both in the time-series and in the cross-section.

+ **Maximizing the Sharpe Ratio: A Genetic Programming Approach**, with Guofu Zhou and Yingzi Zhu 
  + Presented at:  2018 IAFDS, 2019 CFPDS, 2019 CFRIC, 2020 China FinTech Conference, 2021 CICF, 2023 AMES, 2024 AFA (scheduled).
  + Available at: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3726609](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3726609)
  + While common machine learning algorithms focus on minimizing the mean-square errors of model fit, 
  we show that genetic programming, GP, is well-suited to maximize an economic objective, the Sharpe ratio of 
  the usual spread portfolio in the cross-section of expected stock returns. In contrast to popular regression-based 
  learning tools and the neural network, GP can double their performance in the US, and outperform them internationally. 
  We find that, while the economic objective plays a role, GP captures nonlinearity in comparison with methods like Lasso, 
  and it requires smaller sample than neural network.

+ **Overnight-Intradat Reversal Everywhere**, with Robert Kosowski, Chun Liu, and Tianyu Wang
  + Presented at 2016 AsianFA, 2016 CICF
  + Available at: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=3726609](https://ssrn.com/abstract=3726609)
  + A strategy that buys securities with low past overnight returns and sells securities with high 
  past overnight returns generates sizeable out-of-sample excess returns and Sharpe ratios. 
  This strategy -- labelled as overnight-intraday reversal strategy -- outperforms the conventional
  short-term reversal strategy for major international equity markets and futures written on equity indices, 
  interest rates, commodities, and currencies. Consistent with time-varying limits to arbitrage we find that 
  cross-sectional return volatility explains the returns from this strategy.

  
+ **Return Asymmetry and the Cross-section of Stock Returns: Theory and Evidence**, with Yingzi Zhu
  + We extend the CAPM to incorporate the return asymmetry in the cross-section of stock returns. We
motivate our asymmetry measure based on a general return distribution beyond normal distribution and
derive the risk premium due to asymmetry. Empirically, our asymmetry measure negatively predicts the
expected cross-sectional returns. The further decomposition shows that the idiosyncratic asymmetry
dominates the systematic asymmetry in stocks with greater individual investor participation, although on
average, the systematic asymmetry dominates.

+ **Choosing Factors: Explanatory Power vs Model Parsimony**
  + We examine which factor collection, in the model space spanned by existing factors, performs best in terms of the balance between explanatory power and model parsimony. Taking the union of the factors in the recent notable models, our comparison of 512 models shows that Liu, Zhou, and Zhuâ€™s (2020) four factor model achieves the greatest explanatory power measured by the Sharpe ratio among all those satisfying model parsimony condition. Moreover, this model exhibits greater ability in explaining various test assets, and it also earns persistent premium.

+ **Overnight-intraday Reversal in China**, (in Chinese) with Ronghua Qu and Tianyu Wang
  + We find a significant overnight-intraday reversal effect in the Chinese A share stock market, i.e., the
stocks with lower (higher) overnight returns will on average earn higher (lower) future intraday returns.
This overnight-intraday reversal effect substantially outperforms the traditional reversal effect by earning
a much higher daily return of 1.12% and a greater annualized Sharpe ratio up to 18.02. Moreover, this
effect increases with the stock illiquidity, the short-sale constraint, and individual ownership, indicating
that the illiquidity premium and investor sentiment are the two driving forces behind this reversal effect.
