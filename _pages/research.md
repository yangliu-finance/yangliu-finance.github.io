+ **Trend Factor in China: The Role of Large Individual Trading**, with Guofu zhou and Yingzi Zhu
  + A 4-factor model in China with a trend factor, in addition to the market, size, and value in Liu, Stambaugh, and Yuan’s (2019, LSY) 3-factor model, explains all reported anomalies better than LSY and other
notable 4- and 5-factor models. Accounting for the dominant participation of individual trading, the trend
factor captures salient relevant price and volume trends, and earns a monthly Sharpe ratio of 0.48 -- much
greater than that of the market (0.11), size (0.20), and value (0.28). Moreover, our model can explain
mutual fund returns, working as an analogue of Carhart’s (1997) 4-factor model in China.

+ **Return Asymmetry and the Cross-section of Stock Returns: Theory and Evidence**, with Yingzi Zhu
  + We extend the CAPM to incorporate the return asymmetry in the cross-section of stock returns. We
motivate our asymmetry measure based on a general return distribution beyond normal distribution and
derive the risk premium due to asymmetry. Empirically, our asymmetry measure negatively predicts the
expected cross-sectional returns. The further decomposition shows that the idiosyncratic asymmetry
dominates the systematic asymmetry in stocks with greater individual investor participation, although on
average, the systematic asymmetry dominates. 

+ **Overnight-intraday Reversal in China**, (in Chinese) with Ronghua Qu and Tianyu Wang
  + We find a significant overnight-intraday reversal effect in the Chinese A share stock market, i.e., the
stocks with lower (higher) overnight returns will on average earn higher (lower) future intraday returns.
This overnight-intraday reversal effect substantially outperforms the traditional reversal effect by earning
a much higher daily return of 1.12% and a greater annualized Sharpe ratio up to 18.02. Moreover, this
effect increases with the stock illiquidity, the short-sale constraint, and individual ownership, indicating
that the illiquidity premium and investor sentiment are the two driving forces behind this reversal effect.
