excerpt: We examine the evolution of the risk-neutral density as an option approaches maturity. We propose an estimator which does not bias the measurement over time as an alternative to standard nonparametric approaches. We then estimate the density for options with the same expiration date, and compute measures of information.  Parametric analysis shows the majority of information in our approximate risk-neutral measure accrues near maturity according to a logarithmic or power law. No existing theoretical model describes this process.
