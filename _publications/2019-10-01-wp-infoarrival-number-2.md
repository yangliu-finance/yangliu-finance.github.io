excerpt: Job Market Paper. I introduce a new high-frequency analysis of options written on the S&P 500, and quantify in real-time the information contained in the probability measure implied by option prices. I find the intraday flow of information summarizing the expected future price of the index is not continuous, and often increases in discrete intervals. This fact is used to identify large-information events over the six years in othe sample.
